# Fairness for Machine Learning on Graphs : a Survey

This repository contains additional elements for the survey paper on fairness
for Machine Learning, including :

- `benchmarks.md` provide links to download the benchmark graphs listed in the
article
- `sota.md` contains links to the github repositories with state-of-the-art
models implementation.
- `synthetic` is a folder that contains the code to generate the synthetic
graphs G1--G6 and the script to produce the visualisation presented in the survey. 
    - Example to visualise g1
    `python script_visualisation.py g1` 

**If your paper does not appear in this survey, but seems relevant to its contents, please let us know, and we will try to include it in
the revised versions.**
